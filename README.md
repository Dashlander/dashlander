# Down into the Rabbit Hole we Go!

1. Hi, I’m Nishant Tatar, and my Github is [@Dashlander](https://github.com/Dashlander)
2. I’m interested in Systems Programming, Linux, and Basic Networking technologies.
3. Some things about me:
  - I wish to contribute to Open Source, having your code out there that other people would use for their needs is a very cathartic experience.
  - Just starting out my journey as a Developer.
  - I've been using Linux for the past 7 years.
  - Installed Arch as a calming exercise everytime I'm stressed... Talk about unhealthy coping mechanisms...

If you're interested in talking about Linux, Systems, Computer Architecture, FOSS, or Tech in General, hit me up. You can reach me over Discord: Dashlander#3660 or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishant-tatar-96b2b6227/)
