# Down into the Rabbit Hole we Go!

1. Hi, I’m Nishant Tatar, and my Github is [@Dashlander](https://github.com/Dashlander)
2. I’m interested in Linux and Basic Networking technologies.
3. Some things about me:
  - I've been using Linux for the past 7 years.
  - Installed Arch as a calming exercise everytime I'm stressed... Talk about unhealthy coping mechanisms...

If you're interested in talking about Linux, FOSS, or Tech in General, hit me up. You can reach me over Discord: dashland3r or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dashlander/).
