#Down into the Rabbit Hole we Go!

- Hi, I’m Nishant Tatar, and my Github is @Dashlander
- I’m interested in Systems Programming, DevOps, and Basic Networking technologies.
- 
- Some things about me:
  - I wish to contribute to Open Source, having your code out there that other people would use for their needs is a very cathartic expereince.
  - Just starting out my journey as a Developer, we'll see how this goes.
  - I've been using Linux for the past 5 years.
  - Installed Arch as a calming exercise everytime I'm stressed... Talk about unhealthy coping mechanisms...

- If you're interested in talking about Linux, Systems, Computer Architecture or Tech in general, hit me up.
